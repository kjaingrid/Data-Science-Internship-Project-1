# UK-DALE Dataset Analysis  

This repository contains the UK-DALE dataset, which provides detailed power consumption data from five different houses. The dataset is useful for time-series analysis, anomaly detection, and energy consumption pattern analysis.  

## Dataset Structure  

The dataset consists of five folders, each corresponding to one of the five houses (`house1` to `house5`). Each folder contains:  

- **`readme.txt`** â€“ Documentation specific to the house, including channel descriptions, data format, and power measurement details.  
- **CSV Files** â€“ Power consumption data for different appliances. If the dataset is large, these files may be provided as a ZIP archive.  
- **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** â€“ Code for analyzing and processing the dataset, including visualization and feature extraction.  

## House 5 Analysis  

For this analysis, **House 5** was selected as the primary focus. The key files for this analysis are:  

- **`final.ipynb`** â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis of House 5, including data processing, visualization, and insights.  
- **`blog_kunal_jain.pdf`** â€“ The main blog documenting findings, patterns, and insights from the analysis.  
- **`appendix_kunal_jain.pdf`** â€“ Additional supplementary materials and extended discussions related to the blog.  

## Usage  

1. Navigate to the folder of the required house (`house1` to `house5`).  
2. Extract the dataset (if provided as a ZIP file).  
3. Open `final.ipynb` to explore and analyze the House 5 dataset.  
4. Refer to `blog_kunal_jain.pdf` for key findings and `appendix_kunal_jain.pdf` for additional details.
